Can you describe a scenario where we migrate away from Postman to our own testing framework? 
Specifically, what would be the framework architecture you would use for automated testing and report generation?

Please walk me through the steps you would take to ensure a smooth migration and 
how you would mitigate any potential risks or issues that might arise during the process.
